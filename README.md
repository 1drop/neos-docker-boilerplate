# Dockerized Neos project boilerplate

This is an easy customizable Neos docker boilerplate based on the [TYPO3 docker boilerplate](https://github.com/webdevops/TYPO3-docker-boilerplate) by the awesome team webdevops.
It has some minor changes to have an optimized environment to use it with Neos instead of TYPO3.

This is supposed to be used with [Dinghy](https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy) as replacement for docker-machine
to make your life much easier.
You can also read about this in our [blogpost](http://blog.1drop.de/en/developing-neos-with-docker/).

Modifications made for Neos:

* Enable Ubuntu PHP7 as default app container (PHP7 in Debian is currently broken, see [this issue](https://github.com/gplessis/dotdeb-php/issues/124) on Github for details)
* Keep Flow Temporary inside the container to dramatically increase performance
* Modify nginx to deal with Flow
* Adapt internal host to dinghy default hostnames (*.docker)
* Set docker env variable for dinghy reverse proxy

## How to use it

    git clone https://github.com/webdevops/Neos-docker-boilerplate
    cd Neos-docker-boilerplate
    make create neos
    make up
    
After a few seconds your environment is ready and you can access it at http://neos.docker/setup
